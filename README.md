Have you heard that Docker is for server apps only? That's poppycock, you know!

Packhaus is designed to run Windows applications directly from the container. It's possible because Wine 8.5.0 + ppa:cybermax-dexter/sdl2-backport source, Winetrics & X-Server is inside. Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.2 & some other toys are pre-installed too. Packhaus was made specially for Pilotdev team projects but you can also use it for your own purposes. Packhaus is based on ideas & Dockerfile of marvellous Docker-Wine project by Scotty Hardy (https://github.com/scottyhardy/docker-wine).

## On Docker Hub
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/bileyg/packhaus

## How to:

```bash
docker run -it --name="packhaus" --hostname="$(hostname)" --env="DISPLAY" --volume="${XAUTHORITY:-${HOME}/.Xauthority}:/root/.Xauthority:ro" --volume="/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:ro" bileyg/packhaus /bin/bash
```
and then (to test how it works):
```bash
wine notepad
```
